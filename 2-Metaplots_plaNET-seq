## To create metaplots for both sense and antisense RNA for target genes on plaNET-seq processed data, ngs.plot.r (https://github.com/shenlab-sinai/ngsplot) was used:

ngs.plot.r -G Tair10 -R bed -E <here is the name of custom bed file> -C <here is the gene config file with bam files names and also bed file names metagene profiles>
 
# For the metaplots centered on the first nucleosomes, the TSS annotation was retrieved from GSE113677 and DANPOS2 (https://sites.google.com/site/danposdoc/home) was used to find the first nucleosomes' positioning prior to ngs.plot. From DANPOS2 output:
 
cat col0.ref_adjust.xls \
  | tail -n +2 \
  | sort -k1,1 -k4,4n \
  | awk -v OFS="\t" '{ print $1, $2, $3, "col0_pooled_nuc_"NR, ".", ".", $5, $6, $7, $8 }' > col0_summits.bed

# Assign each TSS its closest downstream nucleosome. Make sure the assigned nucleosome is within the gene body and filter by fuzziness significance or by distance to the TSS.

bedtools closest -a TSS -b nucleosomes -D "a" -iu
